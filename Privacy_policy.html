    <div class="section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        SpikeX (the “App”) provides market movement alerts and news headlines related to cryptocurrency markets.
        This Privacy Policy explains what data the App processes, how it is used, how it is shared, data retention
        practices, and how you can contact the developer.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The App does not require user account creation.</li>
        <li>The App does not request or intentionally collect personal identifiers such as name, email address, or phone number.</li>
        <li>The App may process network identifiers (such as IP address) as part of normal network communication and security operations.</li>
        <li>The App fetches public news headlines via a developer-controlled proxy server.</li>
        <li>The App stores a short-term local cache of recent headlines on the device to support offline viewing.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Information the App collects and processes</h2>

      <h3>a) Data transmitted to developer-controlled server(s)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Request metadata:</strong> HTTPS requests to the news proxy endpoint (for example, query parameters such as <code>days=3</code>).
          Requests include standard HTTP headers (such as User-Agent and Accept), which may reveal general device and software information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Network identifiers:</strong> The proxy server processes the client IP address as part of normal network communication
          and server logging. An IP address may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What is not collected:</strong> The App does not intentionally transmit advertising identifiers, precise location data,
      financial account information, authentication credentials, or contact details.</p>

      <h3>b) Data returned to the App</h3>
      <p>
        The proxy server returns public announcement data in JSON format. Typical fields include:
        <code>id</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>url</code>, <code>publishedTsUtc</code>, and optionally <code>summary</code>.
      </p>

      <h3>c) Local data stored on the device</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cached news and announcements stored locally for a short retention period (default: up to 3 days).</li>
        <li>Local preferences (for example, UI or theme settings) stored using SharedPreferences. These do not contain personal identifiers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>d) Third-party libraries</h3>
      <p>
        The App uses standard open-source libraries (including Ktor, Jetpack Compose, and kotlinx.serialization) to provide core
        functionality. The App does not intentionally include analytics or advertising SDKs that collect personal data.
        If such SDKs are added in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. How information is used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide the App’s core functionality, including delivering market alerts and displaying news.</li>
        <li>To operate and secure the proxy server (for example, logging, debugging, and abuse prevention).</li>
        <li>To cache data locally and reduce repeated network requests.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The App does not sell personal data.</li>
        <li>
          Data may be processed by infrastructure or hosting providers operating the proxy server on behalf of the developer,
          solely for providing and maintaining the service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Information may be disclosed if required to comply with legal obligations or lawful requests by authorities.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-device cache:</strong> cached announcements are retained for a short period (default: up to 3 days).</li>
        <li><strong>Server logs:</strong> operational logs (which may include IP addresses) are retained for a limited period
            for security and abuse-prevention purposes (typically up to 30 days) and then deleted or rotated.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Network communication uses HTTPS encryption.</li>
        <li>Access to developer-controlled server data is restricted to authorized personnel.</li>
        <li>No method of transmission or storage is completely secure; absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>7. International data transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Server infrastructure may be located outside your country of residence. By using the App, you acknowledge that
        limited data (such as IP address and request metadata) may be processed in other jurisdictions.
      </p>

    <div class="section">
