Privacy Policy — SpikeX
Last updated: 2025-12-13

Overview
SpikeX (the “App”) provides market movement signals and news headlines. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, how it is shared, data retention practices, user rights, and how to contact the developer.

1. Summary
- The App does not require account creation.
- The App does not collect personal identifiers (name, email) by default.
- The App fetches public news headlines from a developer-controlled news proxy; standard network metadata (including the device IP as seen by the server) and standard HTTP headers are incidentally logged by the proxy server.
- The App caches fetched headlines locally for a short period to enable offline viewing.

2. Information the App collects and transmits
a) Data sent from the App to developer-controlled server(s)
- Request metadata: HTTPS GET requests to the news proxy endpoint (e.g., parameter days=3). The request necessarily includes standard HTTP headers (User-Agent, Accept, etc.). These headers may include general device/software information but do not include user account credentials.
- Network address: the proxy server sees the client IP address as part of normal HTTP logging.
What is NOT sent: the App does NOT send user email addresses, device unique identifiers intentionally (such as Advertising ID), or account credentials in normal operation.

b) Data returned to the App
- The proxy returns JSON announcement objects. Typical fields: id, title, url, publishedTsUtc (timestamp), and optionally summary and translated titles.

c) Local data stored by the App
- Local cache of recent announcements (kept for a short retention period, default: 3 days). The App may trim or purge older cached items automatically.
- Local SharedPreferences for simple configuration (theme, preferences). These do not contain PII by default.

d) Third-party libraries
- The App uses third-party libraries (Ktor, Jetpack Compose, kotlinx.serialization, etc.). These libraries may open network connections or perform internal telemetry only if you or the library enable them. The App does not deliberately include analytics/advertising SDKs that collect personal data. If analytics or crash-reporting is added in a future update, the policy will be updated and users will be informed.

3. How we use information
- Provide the App’s core functionality: fetching and displaying news/headlines and market signals.
- Operational logging and abuse control on the proxy server (request logs, rate-limiting, debugging).
- Local caching to provide offline viewing and reduce repeated network requests.

4. Sharing and disclosure
- We do not sell personal information.
- We may disclose information to:
  - Service providers or hosting providers who operate the proxy server on our behalf (they process logs as part of normal operations).
  - Law enforcement or regulators when required by law.
- We do not share identifiable personal information with advertisers or analytics vendors (unless explicitly stated in a future update).

5. Retention
- Local cache: announcements are cached locally for a short period (default: 3 days). The App may trim or purge older cached items automatically.
- Server logs: request logs on the proxy server (including IP addresses) are retained for a limited period for operational and abuse-prevention purposes. Recommended retention: 30 days. Logs are rotated and periodically deleted.
- If you request deletion of all stored data (see Section 8), we will remove any user-specific data we control subject to verification and applicable legal obligations. Note: server logs may persist for a short time as described above.

6. Security
- We use HTTPS for network requests to protect data in transit.
- Access to developer-controlled server logs and data is restricted to authorized personnel only.
- While we strive to store data securely, no system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security of data transmitted over the internet.

7. International transfers
- The proxy server and hosting infrastructure may be located outside the user’s country. By using the App you consent to transfer of data (such as your IP address and request metadata) to the country where the server is hosted.

8. Your rights and choices
- Notifications: you may revoke notification permissions in the system settings at any time.
- Data deletion and requests: to request deletion of data that we control (for example, data associated with a support request), contact us (see Section 10). We will respond within a reasonable timeframe (typically within 30 days).
- Opt-out: If we introduce analytics or other data collection in the future, we will offer ways to opt out and will update this policy.

9. Children
- The App is not designed for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information.

10. Contact
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or want to request data deletion, contact: umarrr9800@gmail.com

11. Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date at the top and publish changes at this URL. Significant changes will be highlighted in the App or otherwise communicated.

      <h2>Play Console: Foreground service rationale (copy)</h2>
      <button class="btn" data-copy="rationale">Copy rationale</button>
      <div id="rationale" class="copyArea" contenteditable="false">
Foreground service justification:
"The app runs a foreground service (foregroundServiceType=dataSync) to maintain an active network connection and deliver timely market movement alerts and notifications. Without a foreground service the OS may suspend network activity causing missed signals."
      </div>
      <p class="hint">Use this text when Play Console asks to justify a foreground service.</p>

      <h2>Play Console: Data Safety mapping (copy)</h2>
      <button class="btn" data-copy="datasafety">Copy Data Safety mapping</button>
      <div id="datasafety" class="copyArea" contenteditable="false">
Recommended Data Safety answers (confirm actual behavior before submitting):

- Data collected/transmitted off-device:
  - Device or other identifiers: YES — network address (IP) and standard HTTP headers (User-Agent). Purpose: App functionality (fetch headlines) and operational logs. Stored on developer-controlled server; not sold.
  - Diagnostics: NO (unless crash-reporting/analytics is later added).
  - Other personal info (name, email, phone): NO.
  - Location: NO.
  - Financial info: NO.
  - Contacts, calendar, photos: NO.
  - Health, sensitive: NO.

- Data shared with third parties:
  - YES — hosting/service providers that operate the proxy server (processing logs). Purpose: App functionality, operations, abuse prevention. Not sold.

- Encryption:
  - Encryption in transit: YES (HTTPS).

- Data deletion support:
  - YES — provide contact email umarrr9800@gmail.com. Typical response time: 30 days.

Notes: If you add analytics/crash-reporting later (e.g., Firebase, Sentry), update the policy and Data Safety form to list those SDKs and the data they collect.
